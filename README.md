# Xavier’s Cybersecurity Portfolio 🔐

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.  
Here you’ll find hands-on reports, labs, and cheat sheets that I created while studying and practicing SOC analysis, incident response, and offensive/defensive security.  

This repository serves as a central hub to showcase my work and guide you to each project.
