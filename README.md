# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m Xavier.

This repository serves as an index to my cybersecurity work, projects and write ups.
My focus is on understanding **how systems fail**, especially when logic, assumptions or trust models are flawed.

I approach cybersecurity as a mix of:
- technical analysis
- critical thinking
- and clear communication

---

## Areas of focus

### 🔐 Web Application Security
Hands-on labs and write-ups focused on web application vulnerabilities, with emphasis on logic flaws rather than only payloads.

Topics include:
- Authentication & Access Control
- Business Logic vulnerabilities
- Input validation and trust issues

### 🛡️ SOC & Defensive Security
Incident analysis, traffic inspection and defensive workflows.

This area helps me understand:
- how attacks look from the defensive side
- how alerts, logs and network data tell a story

### ☁️ Cloud & Azure Security
Hands on labs focused on Azure security concepts.

I study cloud security because:
- cloud environments are the present and the future
- attackers increasingly target misconfigurations
- security needs to be understood end to end

### 🧩 CTFs & Challenges
Capture The Flag challenges used as a playground to sharpen problem solving and offensive thinking.

### 🌍 Real World Scenarios
Write ups based on real world observations and responsible disclosure.

This includes:
- business logic flaws
- edge cases found by observation
- practical security thinking outside labs

## What I do

I don’t rely only on tools or scanners.

I focus on:
- observing behavior
- questioning assumptions
- understanding flows
- and breaking logic, not just features

Many of the most impactful vulnerabilities are simple, but subtle.

## Final note

This portfolio reflects continuous learning.
It’s not about knowing everything, but about knowing **how to think** when facing unfamiliar systems.
